# Installation

Please clone/fork this repository to get the full functionality.

This project was created using 'react.js' Make sure to have react.js installed before moving forward.

To learn how to install React, [Click Here](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).

Next you will need to install the packages. To do so type in the following commands into your terminal.

```bash
npm install
```
Running this command will download the necessary dependancies for the application to run.

If running locally, make sure to use the 'db' folder to set up the database, as well as running the command

```bash
npx json-server -p 3500 -w data/db.json
```

This will seed your database with a starter environment to work from.

# Concept

For this application, I wanted to display different strings of data from an api. I wanted to dynamically show information to the user.
